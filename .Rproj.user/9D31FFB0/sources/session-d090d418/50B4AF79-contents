# Example Analyses for Data Literacy Course

This gitlab page contains various examples used for Data Literacy. The purpose here is to publish reproducable and updateable code that can be easily accessed within a class. The intent is not to use this to teach, but to pull examples to be used.

## Datasets and Examples

### Avocados
Avocados contains data and analysis of Avocado sales in Atlanta as well as CPI levels from 2020- March 2023.

The avocado data was pulled from the Hass Avocado Board at: https://hassavocadoboard.com/
CPI data was obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics at: https://www.bls.gov/regions/southeast/news-release/consumerpriceindex_atlanta.htm

The analysis compares the impact on Avocado sales in Atlanta by changes in the CPI.

### ACFT
This example updates the RASP example used in Lesson 2 with historical ACFT data obtained from West Point from 2020. It is a fairly small sample, and not the current test. Updating this with more recent data would be great, but this will allow for a better analysis to include logistic regression.
